## 6E1

1. Multi-collinearity -- when multiple variables that are highly correlated are included in a model
2. Post-treatment bias -- variables that are the result of a treatment are better predictors of outcome than the treatment itself, or predict outcome due to an unmeasured effect
3. Collider bias -- including an effect of two or more causes as a predictor for one of those causes induces a correlation between the causes

## 6E2

## 6E3

1. The fork -- a cause that affects two outcomes E1 <- C -> E2 -- E1 $\indep$ E2 | C
2. The pipe -- a line of causes E1 -> E2 -> E3 -- E1 $\indep$ E3 | E2
3. The collider -- an effect that has two causes C1 -> E <- C2 -- C1 !$\indep$ C2 | E
4. The descendant -- a collider that has a downstream effect
